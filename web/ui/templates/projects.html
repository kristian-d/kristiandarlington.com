                    This project, proposed by Sea to Shore Systems and the Saturna Island Marine Research & Education Society (SIMRES), tackles the problem of
                    classifying spectrograms generated by undersea hydrophones as showing a marine vessel transit or not. The algorithm uses a combination of
                    Gaussian smoothing and adaptive thresholding to prepare each spectogram, then determines the primary tones in the image using connected
                    components labelling, connected components filtering, and frequency binning. This histogram, along with a rough measure for the presence
                    of Lloyd's Mirror Pattern, forms a feature vector that is supplied to a Support Vector Machine for final classification. Results were positive
                    on the chosen dataset with approximately 86% values for all of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. This project is ongoing.

                    An interesting experiment in using classifiers of many varieties, "What Lyrics Have to Say" is a project completed with Becca Thomson, a UVIC Computer Science student, that determines
                    the uniqueness of musical genres with respect to their lyrical content. Using a dataset of 380000 songs split into training and testing sets, the classifiers were trained on song vocabularies
                    with their pre-classified genres, then tested by comparing the predicted genres of songs against the actual genres. Preparation of the data included
                    the removal of non-English songs from the dataset and filtering of stop-words from each song. Results showed that Hip-Hop, Country,
                    and Metal were the most identifiable genres by their typical lyrical content when Rock was not included. When Rock was included, however, all genres were
                    significantly less identifiable; it is hypothesized that this is due to Rock being a versatile genre consisting of many different sounds and lyrical themes.

                    TreeGen is an experiment in designing a genetic algorithm from start to finish and using it to find the optimal planting arrangements for the survival of trees
                    given some environmental conditions. The project was completed alongside Rhett Devlin and Austin Lee, both UVIC Software Engineering students. Conditions include
                    the availability of water, availability of sunlight, and soil type in a particular area. The fitness function for the algorithm uses the ratio of surviving trees
                    versus total competition for resources in the environment to provide a score; trees are deemed alive or dead by thresholding the amount of resources in the area
                    surrounding the respective tree, while competition is calculated by summing the number of trees close to another tree. The algorithm terminates when the fitness
                    score ceases to change over a defined number of generations.
